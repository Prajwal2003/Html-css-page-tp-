        Hoysaleswara temple, also popularly known as the Halebidu temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. 
        It is an ancient temple dating back to the 12th century.

        The temple is a renowned Shaivism tradition monument, yet it incorporates themes from Hinduism's Shaktism and Vaishnavism tradition.

        The Hoysala period of South Indian history began about 1000 CE and continued through 1346 CE. 
        In this period, they built around 1,500 temples in 958 centres. 
        Halebidu was originally called Dorasamudra in its inscriptions, possibly derived from Dvarasamudra (Sanskrit words "Dvara" (gateway, door) and Samudra (ocean, sea, large water body)). 
        The capital used to be Belur, Karnataka, but Dorasamudra became the established capital under king Vishnuvardhana and served as the capital of the Hoyasala Empire for nearly 300 years.
        The Hoysaleswara temple is a Shaivism tradition monument, yet reverentially includes many themes from Vaishnavism and Shaktism tradition of Hinduism, as well as images from Jainism. 
        The Hoysaleswara temple is a twin-temple dedicated to Hoysaleswara and Santaleswara Shiva lingas, named after the masculine and feminine aspects, both equal and joined at their transept. 
        It has two Nandi shrines outside, where each seated Nandi face the respective Shiva linga inside. 
        The temple includes a smaller sanctum for the Hindu Sun god Surya.
