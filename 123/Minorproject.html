        A historic fortress and ruined city located in the western outskirts of Hyderabad, Telangana, India. 
        It was originally called Mankal.
        The fort was originally built by Kakatiya ruler Pratāparudra in the 11th century out of mud walls. 
        It was ceded to the Bahmani Kings by Deo Rai, Rajah of Warangal during the reign of Sultan Muhammad Shah (1358-1375 A.D.) of the Bahmani Sultanate.
        Following the death of Sultan Mahmood Shah, the Sultanate disintegrated and Sultan Quli, who had been appointed as the Governor of Telangana by the Bahmani Kings, fortified city and made it the capital of the Golconda Sultanate. 
        Because of the vicinity of diamond mines, especially Kollur Mine, Golconda flourished as a trade centre of large diamonds known as Golconda Diamonds. 
        Golconda Fort is currently abandoned and in ruins.

        The origins of the Golconda Fort can be traced back to the 11th century. 
        It was originally a small mud fort built by Pratāparudra of the Kakatiya Empire.
        The name Golconda is thought to originate from Telugu for "shepherd's hill" .
        It is also thought that Kakatiya ruler Ganapatideva 1199 – 1262 built a stone hilltop outpost — later known as Golconda Fort — to defend their western region.
        The fort was later developed into a fortified citadel in 1518 by Sultan Quli of the Qutb Shahi Empire and the city was declared the capital of the Golconda Sultanate.
        Over a period of 62 years, the mud fort was expanded by the first three Qutb Shahi sultans into the present structure: a massive fortification of granite extending around 5 km (3.1 mi) in circumference. 
        It remained the capital of the Qutb Shahi dynasty until 1590 when the capital was shifted to Hyderabad. 
        The Qutb Shahis expanded the fort, whose 7 km (4.3 mi) outer wall enclosed the city.
        The fort finally fell into ruin in 1687 after an eight-month-long siege led to its fall at the hands of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, who ended the Qutb Shahi reign and took the last Golconda king, Abul Hassan Tana Shah, captive.
